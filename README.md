# Rideshare

Welcome to our cab hailing and car rental website! This website has been built using React for the frontend and Django for the backend.

The website allows users to easily book a cab or rent a car for their transportation needs. Users can search for available vehicles, view details and prices, and make a booking or rental request in just a few clicks.

The website features a user-friendly and intuitive interface that makes it easy to navigate and find the information you need. The website also has a built-in map view that shows the location of available vehicles, so you can see exactly where they are and how close they are to your pickup location.

The website also includes an admin panel, which allows administrator to manage the vehicles and bookings. The administrator can view all the details of the vehicles and the bookings, and make changes as necessary.

I have also implemented a payment gateway to make the payment process easy and secure for the customers.

We have used Django REST framework for the backend, which allows for easy communication between the frontend and backend, and ensures that the website is fast and responsive.

Overall, this website is designed to provide a seamless and convenient experience for booking a cab or rental car, and we hope you find it useful.
